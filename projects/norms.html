                <br>To explore if people's cultural background (i.e., individualistic and collectivistic cultural values) influence their pro-environmental behaviors
                <br>To explore if Baby Bommers, Generation X and Millennials behave differently in environmental protection

                                    on the elder due to their preference of collectivism including pursuing conformity and interdependence, whereas the effect of descriptive norms is relatively weaker on the younger due to their preference

                <ul>
                    <li>Results of this study will help to understand how people with individualistic or collectivistic cultural values behave pro-environmentally differently by the intervention of descriptive norms.</li>
                    <li>Theoretically, the findings will supplement the existing body of pro-environmental behavior literature from the perspectives of cross culture and cross generations.</li>
                    <li>Practically, being aware of consumersâ€™ cultural and generational background helps hospitality industry better utilize descriptive norms in nudging energy conservation, green products purchase.</li>
