                <b>Background:</b>
                <h6>Tour guides have long been a staple of human travel, providing a valuable learning experience and influencing tourists' decisions to revisit. Audio guides have emerged as a new medium that caters to visitors' enhanced needs for mobility and information, enabling them to have a personalized learning experience at their own pace and interest.<br><br>
                The development of audio guides began in the 1950s with the use of radio tour guides at the Amsterdam Museum. Since then, the technology has evolved to overcome the limitations of time and space, giving rise to mobile audio tour guides that allow visitors to interact with destinations in new ways. For road trippers, who prefer to explore new destinations at their own pace, audio tour guides are particularly appealing as they provide mobility and personalized learning experiences. However, current audio tour guides are not widely accepted due to poor content design, which can be perceived as boring or educational-oriented.<br><br>
                To enhance the user experience of audio tour guides and encourage greater acceptance and usage among road trippers, this project aims to provide road trippers with the content they want to hear and a dynamic way to present that content. The project consists of two studies; the first study aimed to identify the content road trippers want to hear, and the second study aims to improve the sound design of audio tour guides.

            <b>Study 1:</b>
            <h6>In the first study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 road trip travelers to identify their motivations for taking self-drive tours. We found that road trippers value freedom the most when taking self-drive tours, and they want to hear about history the most for all levels of destinations. The content road trippers want to hear varies according to destination levels, with an overview and cultural differences being more important for foreign countries or states, while nearby attractions and local festivals are more important for cities.<br><br>
                Based on the findings, we suggested that audio tour guides provide options for routes and offer suggestions for common personal belongings to satisfy travelers' needs for freedom. We also found that the broader the information provided for the destination, the higher the destination level is. Thus, audio tour guides should provide a big picture first, such as an overview and cultural differences, followed by more detailed information such as nearby attractions and local festivals.<br>
