            <p><b>Summary:</b>
                <h6>The festivalization of events is a growing trend that involves incorporating elements of carnival into business events and conventions to improve attendee engagement. As this trend continues, it is important to understand how the inclusion of leisure activities can enhance conference enjoyment. This research aims to explore the impact of leisure activities on academic conference attendees' overall trip enjoyment, introducing the concept of "Cleisure" - the combination of academic conference and leisure.
                <br><br>To predict potential tourists' behavior based on their attitudes towards enjoyable activities, we constructed a questionnaire to gather opinions on 35 conference activities. The results of this research can inform the development of leisure programming for professional and academic conferences. Notably, female respondents demonstrated a significantly higher preference for meditation sessions to relax and refresh compared to their male counterparts. Additionally, females expressed a greater desire for private time than male respondents. These gender-based differences highlight the unique needs of female conference attendees, which warrant further investigation.

                        <li>Significant gender gaps were detected for different activities. For example, females showed higher preference for “attending meditation sessions” which indicates they prefer to have more private time, compared to their

                        </li>
                        <li>Six aspects were identified under the construct of conference leisure. <span class=" font-italic text-muted">(i.e., conference-extension activities, routine-travel activities,
